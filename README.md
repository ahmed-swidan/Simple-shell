allows you to run other programs.

1. The internal shell command "exit" which terminates the shell

- System calls: exit()

2. A command with no arguments

  is abnormal, print out a message to that effect.
- System calls: fork(), execvp(), exit(), wait()

3. A command with arguments

- Example: ls â€“l
- Details: Argument 0 is the name of the command.

  not blocking until the command finishes.
